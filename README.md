# Project: Mint Sign Up Clone 
A static page project built for [The Odin Project Ruby on Rails Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms) to practice form design with HTML & CSS. The page mimics the design of [this](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Ftask%3DS) sign up form from Mint.com. Encouraged to use Flexbox and Grid, however not limited to those techniques. 

## Features 
This is a close remake, but not exact copy. Similar fonts were used due to the copyrights on the original fonts used on their website. All links and buttons are not linked to other pages, as the exercise was focused on the visual aspects rather than the function.
